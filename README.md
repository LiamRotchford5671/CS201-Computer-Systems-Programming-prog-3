Description:

You are provided with a program that takes a filename as command line parameter. Then it opens the
specified file and reads 2 matrices from this file. Finally it calls function ByteMult() to compute the
Matrix-Matrix multiplication of 2 square matrices and prints out the resulting matrix and the execution
time elapsed. Your job is to implement 2 optimized versions of function ByteMult(). You will implement
these 2 versions by modify the provided implementation of ByteMult().We will unroll the most inner loop of the multiplication algorithm. You must unroll the loop 4 and 8 times and submit the resulting code as mult4.c and mult8.c
